Hi, and thanks for visiting :) My name is Quinn and I'm a PhD Candidate in Social Psychology at the University of Virginia working with Dr. Wilson. I study interpersonal perception, and in particular, the dynamics of conversation: people’s beliefs about their conversational abilities, how they actually do, and how to make conversations go better. In Summer and Fall 2021, I am interning at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service in Charlottesville, Virginia (with the Center for Survey Research and Demographics Research Group). Before coming to UVA, I was the lab manager in Dr. David Yeager's Adolescent Development Research Lab and an AmeriCorps member in Austin, Texas. I also hold a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from UT Austin.
